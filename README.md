<!-- Short description of what your project does(3-4 senetnces)-->
A small project I created with the purpose of creating shapes. I decieded to create this project with the ability to demostarte my skills in creating shapes. In addition, I also decieded to mess around with the hover effect for people to enjoy moving their mouse over each shape. 

## Technologies

All you gotta do is just hover your cursor over each shape and you will withness the various effects each shape will do once you hover over each shape. 
<!-- What the users can do -->

## The Process
I created this project by storing all of my CSS code in style.css and placed all of my html code in another file. I first created divs for each shape and then adjusted the postion of each shape based on the previous shape I completed. From their it was all ablout creating their properties and using the hover effect to demonstrated what I could do with each hover effect. 
<!-- The process of how I build it -->

## What I learned
What I learned from this project was utilizing the clip-path property. Using clip-path allows for simplicty for creating complex shapes in the future.
